                                But, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
                                The player can choose to HOLD, which means that his CURRENT score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
                                The first player to reach 50 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
